Jordan’s Quantitative & Proprietary Trading Portfolio

Welcome! This repository showcases my hands-on work in trading, quantitative finance, and financial modeling, bridging theory with real-world execution. Each project highlights my ability to design, backtest, and implement trading strategies, combining Python, Excel, and machine learning to produce actionable results.

Projects Overview
1. Smart Hedger — Dynamic Delta-Hedging Simulator

The Smart Hedger is a Python-based simulator that models dynamic delta-hedging strategies for options portfolios under realistic market conditions. Using Black-Scholes pricing, geometric Brownian motion simulations, and automated hedge adjustments, it tracks portfolio PnL, hedge ratios, and option values over time. Transaction costs and rebalancing frequency are included to reflect practical trading scenarios. This project demonstrates applied risk management, exposure control, and the ability to translate quantitative finance theory into actionable trading decisions.

2. Volatility Forecast Engine — GARCH & Machine Learning Hybrid

This engine combines GARCH statistical modeling with machine learning to generate hybrid volatility forecasts for trading applications. It processes historical price data, computes returns, and uses feature engineering to train predictive models. Outputs include predicted versus actual volatility, error metrics, and feature importance visualizations. The project highlights quantitative signal generation, predictive analytics, and risk forecasting, making it directly applicable to trading strategy development and portfolio management.

3. Stock & Option Pricing Models (Excel + Python)

This project implements Black-Scholes, Binomial, and Monte Carlo simulations for calls and puts in both Excel and Python. It calculates option prices, Greeks, and payoff scenarios, offering a hands-on approach to understanding derivatives pricing. The combination of Excel and Python demonstrates both interactive modeling for learning and programmatic implementation for practical applications, serving as a foundation for trading strategy development and risk assessment.

4. Finance Equations Workbook

A continuously updated Excel workbook compiling all essential finance calculations for corporate finance, investment analysis, and trading applications. It includes the Big Three financial statements (Income Statement, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow), stock and option pricing formulas, and key quantitative finance calculations. Actively maintained, it serves as both a reference guide and practical tool, supporting analysis, strategy evaluation, and hands-on problem solving.

5. Automated Trading Bot (Proprietary)

A multi-asset, ML-enabled trading system designed to execute quantitative strategies while tracking performance and risk. Although the code is proprietary and not included, documentation, dashboards, and results illustrate its functionality. This project demonstrates full-stack trading system development, from signal generation and strategy design to automated execution and real-time portfolio monitoring, reflecting skills highly relevant to both proprietary trading and quantitative trading roles.
